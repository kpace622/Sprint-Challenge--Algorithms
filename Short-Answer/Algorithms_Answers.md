#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) # O(n) due to the size of n or would what it be O(log n) due to n being multiplied each iteration



b) # O(n * log n) while loop would be log n because the number is doubling every iteration otherwise the whole function would be O(n ^ 2)? 



c) # O(n) recursive function that runs n time where n is bunnies 

## Exercise II

# Binary search. I would pick the floor in the middle of the building, throw an egg. If the egg breaks, pick a new middle floor where the current floor becomes the top. If the egg doesn't # # break pick a new middle floor higher up where the bottom would be the floor you are currently on. Repeat until you pinpoint the highest floor where the egg doesn't break.
# Binary search is O(log n)
